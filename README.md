### ✅ Project 2 — Financial Variance & Trend Analysis 
**Goal:** Analyze **budget vs actual performance over time**, highlighting variance dollars and percentages with interactive filtering to identify where over‑ or under‑spend is occurring.

**Highlights**
- KPI layer: **Total Budget**, **Total Actual**, **Variance ($)**, **Variance (%)**
- Visuals: **Budget vs Actual (Monthly)**, **Monthly Variance ($)** with a zero baseline
- Time‑aware modeling using a continuous date axis for accurate trend analysis

### ✅ Project 3 — Operational Process Improvement (Lean CI) *(Complete)*

**Goal:** Evaluate operational performance using **Lean (CI)** metrics—cycle time, backlog, and throughput—and assess the impact of a process change using a clear **Before vs After** comparison.

**Highlights**
- KPI layer: **Cycle Time (Days)**, **Cycle Time Improvement (% & Days)**, **Throughput**, **Open Backlog**
- Visuals: **Average Cycle Time (Before vs After)**, **Open Backlog by Category**, **Throughput (Before vs After)**
- Demonstrates measurable cycle‑time reduction while maintaining throughput
- Interactive slicers for **Category** and **Owner** to support targeted analysis
